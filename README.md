### ASCII Graphics Library

As of now, the library only seeks to provide basic drawing functions, but I plan to be able render .obj files as well as have 3d scenes to render.

(This is my first time writing a library as well as using Git/Github, advice and criticism is appreciated :))

Roadmap:
2D Structs and Functions: ğŸŸ¢
[Might have memory safety issues somewhere though]
3D Structs and Functions: ğŸŸ¡
[Can only render spheres with flat lighting as of now; scenes are also currently unchangeable after initialization]
[Lighting is in progress]
Raytracer: ğŸŸ¡
[Renders flat spheres, probably has a memory leak, will check with valgrind at some point]
[Implementing light next, then general polygon rendering]
UI: ğŸ”´
[ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚]
Docs: ğŸ”´
[Minimal library anyway, docs should be easy (totally) (mhm)]
